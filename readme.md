##Compiling
* Download the source from this repo, either with git or as a zip/tarball.
* Install maven or Eclipse
* If using maven, run `mvn` in the directory you installed it to.
* With Eclipse, open as a project and build as usual

##Pull Request Standards
* Indent with tabs
* Avoid trailing whitespace
* Sign-off your commits
* Avoid merge commits in pull requests
* Squash your commits - have at most one commit per major change

##Updating your fork
Before submitting a pull request, you should ensure that your fork is up to date.
To do this, run these commands:

    git remote add upstream git://github.com/Slowpoke101/FTBLaunch.git
    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push --force origin <branch_name>

The first command is only necessary the first time. If you have issues merging, you will need to get a merge tool such as [P4Merge]().
Once it is set up, run `git mergetool`. Once all conflicts are fixed, run `git rebase --continue`, and `git push --force origin <branch_name>`.

##Automated builds
Automated builds are available [here](http://nallar.me/ftb/b/). This will likely change in the future to use Jenkins.
These should only be used to test if a bug which is in the beta version has been fixed.
