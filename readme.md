##Compiling
* Download the source from this repo, either with git or as a zip/tarball.
* Install Eclipse or IDEA
* you will need project lombok integration installed see http://projectlombok.org/download.html for more info on its IDE integration. Gradle adds this to the classpath for you in the IDE for IDE building
* To build a jar/exe using gradle run 'gradlew build' to generate the .exe version add 'launch4j' to the end after installing launch4j
* To generate IDE project with dependencies using gradle run 'gradlew eclipse' or 'gradlew idea' after running a build.

##Pull Request Standards
* Indent with spaces(4)

* If using eclipse: Use formatter located at eclipse_formatter.xml
* If using Intellij IDEA use the eclipse formatter(there is a plugin for this)
* Sign-off your commits

##Updating your fork
Before submitting a pull request, you should ensure that your fork is up to date.
To do this, run these commands:

    git remote add upstream git://github.com/Slowpoke101/FTBLaunch.git
    git pull --rebase upstream master
    git push --force origin <branch_name>

The first command is only necessary the first time. If you have issues merging, you will need to get a merge tool such as [P4Merge](http://perforce.com/product/components/perforce_visual_merge_and_diff_tools).
Once it is set up, run `git mergetool`. Once all conflicts are fixed, run `git rebase --continue`, and `git push --force origin <branch_name>`.
